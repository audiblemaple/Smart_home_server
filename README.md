# Smart Home 3D Control System - Backend
## currently just a template
Introduction
Welcome to the backend repository of the Smart Home 3D Control System.\
This backend serves as the backbone for the interactive frontend, managing communications, device control, and data processing for the smart home system.\
It's designed to work in tandem with the frontend to provide a seamless user experience in controlling and monitoring smart devices in my home.

## Features
Device Communication: Handles requests from the frontend to interact with smart devices (lights, window blinds, etc.).
Security Integration: Manages the live feed from the entrance camera and ensures secure access.
Network Optimization: Ensures efficient data transfer within the home Wi-Fi network for real-time control and monitoring.
Scalability: Designed to be scalable to accommodate additional smart devices and functionalities as needed.
